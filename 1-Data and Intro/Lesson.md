# What is Programming?
Programming is the all about moving data around. Sometimes you're calculating sales tax. Sometimes you're moving a window the other side of a screen. Either way, you need to know how the computer sees data, and how you can tell it what to do.

## Binary
Since computers are based on electricity, they see data as either high voltage or low voltage. Computer RAM is generally a bunch of capacitors that either have a charge or not. For this example, each piece of information uses 4 capacitors, or contains 4 bits.

Since all data looks the same, just tons of 0(low voltage) and 1(high voltage), computers need to know what type of data they're looking at.

## Numbers
Like decimal, binary counts up from 0 but only has one other digit. In our example 4 bit computer, a number can be any of the following:
Binary|Decimal
---|---
0000|0
0001|1
0010|2
0011|3
0100|4
0101|5
0110|6
0111|7
1000|8
1001|9
1010|10
1011|11
1100|12
1101|13
1110|14
1111|15
